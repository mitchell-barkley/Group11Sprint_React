Sprint Week Winter 2023
Sprint One

Welcome everyone to the first sprint of Semester 2! This is going to be a React sprint1 that will mostly cover the basics of React discussed so far. For this sprint you will be in charge of creating the front-end component of a website. 
There are two options for this sprint. You can choose either depending upon your groups’ understanding and discussions.
Own idea:
If you have any project ideas you would like to give a try, you are welcome (and encouraged!) to give a proposal to Nicholas Hodder and implement that if approved. The basic requirements for the Sprint are as follows:
•	The website must have at least 3 separate pages/components including App.js. Since we have not directly covered linking between react pages/components, you can call other two components on the App.js (obviously there are better ways to do that – but right now taking into consideration the level of discussion we’ve had so far) 

•	Each page must implement styling using external CSS files for most part. You can apply some common styles in “index.css”. And if preferred, make your own external style sheet- import it and use it in any pages you like.

•	It is required that your styling implements Flexbox and Media queries to make as much responsive as possible. [test with different device options in inspector before submission]

•	The manipulation of the DOM with JavaScript is highly encouraged. Use your imagination and try to come up with some nice manipulations of html pages through JS function calls [This will be a good place to show your JS function skills]

•	You must submit a Figma mock-up for your designs

Some key notes to keep in mind for this project is a good use of HTML5 semantic tags (Which is pivotal for accessibility purposes) [do validate your html before submission – remember no RED elements in your HTML], organization of your code (as it should be easy to tell what is where), and layout/colour choice of the pages (A pleasant design is an important aspect. A simple colour wheel or hex picker can be a powerful tool!).

Default Project

A local restaurant owner, Gary Blue (No relation to Mary Brown), is looking to create a website for his establishment, Gary Blue’s Diner, to increase exposure. Gary however has no idea on how to make such a thing! So, after hearing of a talented up and coming front-end developer on the scene, Gary decides to contact you! 
His first request for you is to create a home page for the website which should be welcoming and give quick info for the establishment like location, hours of operation, and a small summary. Some examples of extra content to add may be positive customer reviews/experiences or a small biography of the owner. On the homepage he wants links to pages for his menus.
Gary Blue is a big foodie and wants to show off what he serves to the world! He wants a menu page on the website for his selection. The menu items should include a title (like for example his signature Big Gary chicken sandwich) and when a menu item is clicked, it should expand to have a description for the meal. If you are up for it, you could search for and add some stock photos for the meals on the menu. A great resource for this would be https://unsplash.com/.  
Looking to stay ahead of the game, Gary also wants you to implement an ordering page where the customer will select what they want, the quantity of said items, and enter their information to be submitted for Gary’s crew to get cooking!
Being a much better chef than he is a web developer, Gary has given you as much creative authority as possible! Use this experience to flex your creative muscles, as a nice-looking design can make a wonderful portfolio piece and help improve your skills for every new project you take on! Good luck to you all!
